01. Multi-Threading in .NET
I've finished first CDP theme, choosed V1 version of tasks. In some tasks interfaces are very ugly, pls don't be very strict.
There are 2 different solutions in different folders. The task #4 from Async-Await part is absent because
i had a similar task few weeks ago and I want to attach the link (the project from this repo also):
https://github.com/isalzh/TravixOpp.TestProjectCore
This project has examples of async CRUD operations.

02. Expressions and IQueryable
about Task #2 Expression Tree part: Realized mapper has contains very primitive implementation, this approach described by the lector
in Q&A video part. Imho, it should be enough. Or not?
about Task #1 IQueryable part: It seems that the task is outdated, requests are not executed as expected, but I tried to do my best
and completed this part.
